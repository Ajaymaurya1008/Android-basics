# Android Basics ðŸš€  

This repository contains all the code I wrote while learning **Android development** with **Kotlin, XML, and Jetpack Compose**. It includes various concepts, experiments, and small projects as I explored the fundamentals of native Android development.  

## ðŸ“Œ What's Inside?  
- Code snippets and examples from my **Android learning journey**  
- Hands-on practice with **Activities, Fragments, UI Design, Networking, and more**  
- Experiments with **Jetpack Compose, MVVM, Room, and Kotlin Coroutines**  
- Personal notes and references for future projects  

## ðŸ’» Learning Resources

- [Android Development course](https://developer.android.com/courses)
- [Kotlin Docs](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/getting-started.html)
- [Android Docs](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/documentation)
- [Material Design](https://m3.material.io)

## Note to self 

- An Android app can have multiple activities. However, it is recommended to have a single activity
- When we override the onCreate() method, we must call the superclass implementation to complete the creation of the Activity, so within it, you must immediately call super.onCreate(). The same is true for other lifecycle callback methods.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose  
This repository serves as a personal reference and a learning log for my **Android development journey**. Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute!
